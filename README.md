# SmartBlog local Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to clone a Node.js website and set it up on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Git
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Steps

1. **Clone the Website**

   Clone the repository of the Node.js website using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Navigate into the cloned directory of the website and install the required dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    cd <website_directory>
    npm install

3. **Configure API Keys**

    Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. You can find a sample .env.sample file in the project directory that contains placeholders for API keys. Copy the sample file and replace the placeholders with your actual API keys.

4. **Start the Project**

    Once you've installed the dependencies and configured the API keys, you can start the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    
This command will start the Node.js server, and you should be able to access the website locally in your browser.
